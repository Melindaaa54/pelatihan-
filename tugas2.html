    <h2><font color="blue">A Brief History of HTML</font></h2>
    <h3><font color="blue">1993 - present</font></h3>
    <p>the first version of HTML was written by time berners-lee 1993.
        since then,there have been many different varsions of HTML.The most widely used version
        throught the 2000's was
        <strong>HTML 4.01</strong>
        which became an official standar in december 1999.
        <p>
            Another version,
            <strong>XHTML,</strong>
            was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language.XML ia a standar markup languages that is used to
            create other markup languages.hunderds 
            of XML languages are in use today,including GML(geography markup language),
            <i><b>MathML, Music ML,</b></i> and <i><b>RSS</b></i> (Realy simpe syndication).
            since each of these shared across applications. This mkes XML potentially very powerful,
            and it's no suprise that the W3C would create an XML version of HTML(again,called XHTML).
            XHTML became an official standar in 2000, and was updated in 2002.XHTML is very similir
            to HTML, but has stricte rules. strict rules are necessary for all XML languages,because
            without it,interoperabilty between applications would be impossible.
            you'll lern more about the differences between HTML and XHTML in 
            <u><font color="blue">Unit 2.</font></u>
            <p>
                most pages on the web today were built using either HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0.
                however,in recent years, he W3C (in collaboration with another organization,The
                <u><font color="blue">WHATWG</font></u>),
                has been working on a brand new version of HTML,
                <b>HTML5</b>.
                Currently(2011),HTML5 is still a draft specificaton, and is not yet
                an official standar. however, it is already widely supported by browsers and other webenabled
                 devices,and is the way of the future. therefore,
                 <b>HTML5 is the primary language taught in this course</b>
                 <p>the following table shows a list of many of the types of content can be
                    added to web page using different version of HTML. in the early days of the web
                    HTML (version 1.2) was very simple, but over time new version were released 
                    that added more and more features. still,if web designers wanted to add conten
                    or features that HTML didn't support,they would have to do so with 
                    non-proprietary technologies suchas adob flash.these technologies would require
                    users to install browser plug-ins,and in some cases meant that certin users would
                    be unable to access the content(for example,iphones and ipads don't support flash).
